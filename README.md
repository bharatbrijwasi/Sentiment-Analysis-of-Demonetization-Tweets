# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Demonetization-Tweets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is the based on the data science as we know that data science is the 

combination of various fields like machine learning, Big data, data 

visualization, data mining, deep learning etc. This project is based on Big data 

and data mining. We talk about data structure so in this project we used semi 

structure data so it regard to big data problems also we used large amount of 

data. And another point in the project is the data mining as mentioned above it 

contain so many outliers in the dataset so we refine that outlier and select only 

that dataset field that is useful for us.

In this project we used dummy dataset that take place from Github repository.

For processing and storage we used hadoop ecosystem it totally complete on 

hadoop framework. 

We provide storage on hadoop distributed file system and 

for processing purpose we used Pig Latin languages. this languages implement 

those developer that is not good in writing a map reduce code. It just like SQL 

like language so it is very easy to learn.


We store raw data on hadoop distributed file system. After processing or 

finalise the result we store that data again in 3 distributed file.

The data set that used in this project is tweets based so we process tweets data. 

In this project we find out the sentiment of tweets that comes in form of tweets.

We check polarity in this project. Polarity is of three type positive polarity mean 

positive sentiment in form tweets, negative polarity, and neutral polarity or 

sometimes is called no polarity in term of sentiment means tweets is form of 

felling no positive view or negative sentiment in tweets. All mining of data is 

done with help of Pig Latin language that was developed in 2006 when hadoop 

comes in market. 

For check the polarity of tweets we give rating to the word that part of tweets. 

Every word has unique rating. Some words have a positive rating or more that 0 

numerical value and some have negative rating means less than 0. And some 

words have 0 rating.
